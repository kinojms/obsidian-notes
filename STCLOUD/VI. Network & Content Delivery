# Network & Content Delivery
- IPv4 (32-bit) - less accurate address; decimal in 8-bit value
- IPv6 (128-bit) - more accurate address; hexadecimal in 4-bit value

## Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
- Network identifier (routing prefix)

##  Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model
- Application: means for an application to access a computer network (HTPPS, FTP, DHCP, LDAP)
- Presentation: ensures that the application layer can read the data; encryption (ASCI, ICA)
- Session: enables orderly exchange of data (NetBIOS, RPC)
- Transport: provides protocols to support host-to-host communication (TCP, UDP)
- Network: routing and packet forwarding (routers; IP)
- Data link: transfer data in the same LAN network (hubs and switches; MAC)
- Physical: transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium (1s and 0s)

# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) / Networking
- gives us an isolated version in the cloud
- users have their own isolated instance
- gives us control over our virtual networking resources, including:
	- selection of IP address range
	- creation of subnets
	- config of route tables and network gateways
- enables you to customize the network configuration for your VPC
- enables you to use multiple layers of security

## VPCs and Subnets
### VPCs:
- logically isolated from other VPCs
- dedicated to your AWS account
- belongs to a single AWS Region 
### Subnets:
- range of IP addresses
- // two more bullets from PPT

## IP Addressing
- when you create a VPC, you assign it to an IPv4 CIDR block (range of private IPv4 addresses)
- cannot change the address range after you create the VPC
- the largest IPv4 CIDR block size is "/16"
- the smallest is "/28"
	- calculation ex: 32 bits - 25 = 7 = 2^7 = 128
- IPv6 is also supported (with a different block size limit)
- CIDR block of subnets cannot overlap

*Note: Routers function the same as firewalls*

Ex: x.x.x.x/28 has 16 addresses
32-28 = 4 = 2^4 = 16

### Public IP Address Types
#### Public IPv4 address
- manually assigned thru an **Elastic IP address**
- automatically assigned through the auto-assign public IP address settings at the subnet level
#### Elastic IP address
- associated with an AWS account
- can be allocated and remapped anytime
- additional costs might apply 
- expensive but at least your IP won't change
