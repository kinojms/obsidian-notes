**Advanced Study Priority**: Process Scheduling & Memory Management

If you make a mistake in the first part of the scheduling (in the exam), then that cascades to the rest of that section.

We are recommended to use C++ 
# MP Part 1
"Madali lang daw" 

Prompt engineering is gonna be a BIG help in using Gen AI as a tool for this.

We are to design a CLI with background and running processes. 

We are going to emulate running a process and emulate memory.

We need our own closed environment with OS stuff

Make sure to review the List of Requirements!
## Program Flow:
1. Doesn't do anything even if you type whatever 
2. Will start if you `initialize` the program using the `config.txt` file
3. `scheduler-test` will add processes in the background
4. `screen -ls` will display all the cores
5. `scheduler-stop` will stop adding processes
6. If you type `screen -ls` after a few minutes/seconds (depending on the # of quantum cycles and memory allocation), then we should see what processes are finished

Needs:
- Process Scheduler Class
- I/O Class
- Memory Management Class

If the processes (after a few minutes) are NOT finished, then there's something wrong

`report-util` command will generate a log (a text file generated by the program which will print out the what's displayed in the CLI)

The CPU Scheduler is **real-time** and will continue schedule processes as long as your console is alive. 

CPU Ticks/Cycles - assume that it's an integer counter that tallies the number of **frame** passes.

**Quantum Cycle** - time allocated to a process execution before switching to another process 
- Question: How does Quantum Cycles work in a FCFS scheduler setup? (Since FCFS won't stop until a process is done)

We are NOT required to make an interpreter

C++ 20 is the version we'll be using
## Process Instructions

- These instructions CAN be nested. 
- We need to have something to randomize the instructions when we type `scheduler-start`.
- Cap the `For loop` to three times
- When the scheduler is running, we need to have a clever way in the program to store variables. 
- These process instructions should already be hardcoded (sort of)
- The inputs should vary (for the variables) 


## Sample Output

# Marquee Code

`cout` cannot be used here

A sample of CPU and I/O

We should be able to type while there's a marquee animation happening at the same time

Screen jitters are normal (?)

If we'll use an open-source package/library, using a single function call to complete the given task (using single function call for the marquee animation) is NOT allowed.

In test cases that take long time, memory leaks are bound to happen if we don't deallocate them properly. We should watch out for this.
