# What is the Stack?
- follows the LIFO principle
- usually, its size is limited, so when it runs out of space, we say the "Stack Overflowed" (absolute cinema ðŸ™Œ)
## Execution Stack
- sometimes called the **Program Stack/Hardware Stack**
- when running a program, theoretically, nothing can prevent us in writing values anywhere in memoryâ€”but this can result in wasting said memory
