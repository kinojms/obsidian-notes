# AWS Shared Responsibility Model
- Shared across all cloud services
- Ex: If you were to go to an Ice Skating Rink, you can rent skates and if something happens, it can be either your fault or the provider's fault

## AWS Responsibility: Security of the cloud
- physical security of data centers
	- controlled, need-based access
- hardware and software infrastructure
	- storage decommissioning, host operating system (OS) access logging, and auditing
	- if the server's OS breaks down, that's not your responsibility
- network infrastructure
	- intrusion detection
- virtualization infrastructure
	- instance isolation
