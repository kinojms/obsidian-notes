The CCS department of DLSU spearheaded a program to provide computational and storage resources to its students and faculty members. However, they are unsure which of the following choices are more *cost-effective per computation or storage capability*:
1. Purchasing a physical machine and deploying it as a **traditional** infrastructure
2. Availing services on the **cloud**, particularly with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud as a possible public cloud provider

The computational and storage considerations of the Colle
