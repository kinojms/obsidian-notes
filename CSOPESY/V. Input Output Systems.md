- I/O Management is a major component of OS design and operation
	- important aspect of computer operation
	- I/O devices can vary
	- various methods to control them
	- performance management (polling rate)
	- new types of devices frequent
- ports, busses, device controllers connect to various devicesâ€”these devices aren't directly connected to the processor, the **device drivers** are the ones connected to the processor
- **Device Drivers** - encapsulate device details
	- present uniform device-access interface to I/O subsystem

- incredible variety
	- storage
	- transmission
	- human-interface
- common concepts - signals from I/O devices interface with computer
	- port - connection point for device (not related to the networking kind of port)
	- bus - daisy chain or shared direct access
		- it's like a highway from the connection point to your processor
