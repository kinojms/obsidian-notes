Cloud Computing Course in DLSU started back in 2018. 

We will use CCS Cloud for the Private Cloud (its free). While we use AWS Academy Cloud for Public.

We're gonna use AWS Academy (Instructure). A separate academic entity from AWS itself. 

Cloud is a methodology. It's a usage. 

How do we use virtualization?

To understand cloud technology, we first look at virtualization. Because cloud is just basically a usage of virtualization.

We'll focus on the generic solution of each technology.

In the exams, we're not gonna take a look at the names of the products, but the technology itself. It's gonna be multiple choice, no solving, maybe 60 items.

**MP1** - No matter which vendor you choose, you must realize that they provide the similar service/solution

**MP2** - You have to understand how much does using cloud technology/solutions actually cost. Has solving part.

**MP3** - Creating a web app with the solutions implemented (DB, Python Models, etc.) then deploy the app.

We will have Knowledge Checksâ€”helps pressure us to study/learn. These are graded as well.

Mini Projects are either by pair or solo.

# Recommended Training Resource for Self-Learning: 
**AWS Academy Cloud Foundations -> Cloud Development** 
- this is because the course is polished. 
- you can claim a badge after!
**Cisco**
- for Networking
