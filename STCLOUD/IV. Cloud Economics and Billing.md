# How do you pay for AWS?
- rent, reserve, volume-based discount, time
- pay for what you use
	- rent / on-demand
	- more demand than reserve
- pay less when you reserve
	- you are committing to a long-term usage of the cloud
	- 1 or 3 yr commitment
	- *Note: If you reserve, you lose scaling on-demand advantage
	- is cheaper than on-demand
- pay less when you use more and as AWS grows
