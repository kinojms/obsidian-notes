# Objective: 
To create a cost estimation of owning and maintaining a machine in the **Cloud** vs that of a **Traditional** infrastructure

# Scenario:
The CCS department of DLSU spearheaded a program to provide computational and storage resources to its students and faculty members. However, they are unsure which of the following choices are more *cost-effective per computation or storage capability*:
1. Purchasing a physical machine and deploying it as a **traditional** infrastructure
2. Availing services on the **cloud**, particularly with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud as a possible public cloud provider

The computational and storage considerations of the College is as follows:
- **CPU** - either a i5 or i7 processor with **8 to 16 cores**
- **Memory** - either **16GB or 32GB**
- **Storage** - either **128GB or 256GB SSD** or **512GB or 1TB HDD**

Part of their proposal is to draft a cost estimate of purchasing and maintaining a physical device compared to availing a cloud service.

// Compare the cost of traditional vs cloud 

Since they are unsure of a lot of things, the College would like to know the following information:
1. **Cost of purchasing and maintaining a physical machine** for both *CapEx* and *OpEx*
