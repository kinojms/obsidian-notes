- I/O Management is a major component of OS design and operation
	- important aspect of computer operation
	- I/O devices can vary
	- various methods to control them
	- performance management (polling rate)
	- new types of devices frequent
- ports, busses, device controllers connect to various devicesâ€”these devices aren't directly connected to the processor, the **device drivers** are the ones connected to the processor
- **Device Drivers** - encapsulate device details
	- present uniform device-access interface to I/O subsystem

- incredible variety
	- storage
	- transmission
	- human-interface
- common concepts - signals from I/O devices interface with computer
	- port - connection point for device (not related to the networking kind of port)
	- bus - daisy chain or shared direct access
		- it's like a highway from the connection point to your processor
		- **bifurcation** - allows a single PCIe slot on a motherboard to be split into multiple smaller lane configurations
- controller (host adapter) - electronics that operate port, bus, device
	- sometimes integrates
	- sometimes separate circuit board
		- in certain architecture, you might want to add additional NVMe's
	- contains processor, microcode, private memory, etc.
	- USB hubs are an example where it becomes a kind of multiplexer for external USB devices (multiple input - one output)
- Fibre channel (FC) is a complex controller, usually separate circuit board (host-bus adapter, HBA plugging into bus)
- I/O instructions control devices
- devices usually registers where device driver places commands, addresses, and data to write, or read data from registers after command execution
	- data-in register, data-out register, status register,
